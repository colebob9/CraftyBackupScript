# CraftyBackupScript
Script to automatically backup any folder, easily and efficiently. Has special features for Minecraft Servers in mind.

## Download

Simply download a .zip file [from the main repo page](https://github.com/colebob9/CraftyBackupScript/archive/master.zip) or download a more stable release [from the Releases Page. (preferred)](https://github.com/colebob9/CraftyBackupScript/releases)

## Features
* Compresses entire folder into a 7zip archive, and puts the archive into the specified folder
* Proper Minecraft save toggling (optional)
* Optional Minecraft server stopping after backup (best for non-peak hours, to be used with [CraftyStartScript](https://github.com/colebob9/CraftyStartScript) for a restart)
* Keeps track of how long a backup can take
* Configuration options to tweak the script to your liking (config options inside script)
* Labels archive with date and time
* Snapshots of the latest backups.

## Instructions
### Backups

Edit the "Config" section inside `CBS-Backup.py` for the server you want to backup. (Completely separate scripts are needed for each different server)

The required sections you need to edit for the script to work are `screenName`, `serverPath`, `filePath`, and the prefix of `archiveName`. Everything else is up to personal preference.

This script is designed to be ran manually or by a [cron job](http://www.howtogeek.com/101288/how-to-schedule-tasks-on-linux-an-introduction-to-crontab-files/). Configure as needed.

Run with command `python3 CBS-Backup.py`

### Snapshots
The file `CBS-Snapshot.py` copies all the most recent backups generated by `CBS-Backup.py`. Making it easier to grab a copy of a live server for development on another computer or to keep the last backups safe from being deleted.

To configure this script, add lines to the bottom specifying the orginal backup save path for each server. Edit the config section as well.

(Example: `snapshot("Archives/Creative/")`) 

This script is meant to be manually triggered as backups are not deleted in the Snapshots folder.

## Requirements
* Python 3 (to run the script)
* Any plain text editor: Notepad++, TextEdit, or nano will do fine.
* Linux packages: `p7zip`, `p7zip-full`, `python3`, `screen`
